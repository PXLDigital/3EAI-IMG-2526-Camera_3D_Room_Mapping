# 3D Camera Mapping Using Stereo Vision

## What is Stereo Vision

**Stereo vision is a method used by humans, animals, and machines to understand depth, how far away things are by using two eyes or two cameras.**
**Each eye (or camera) sees the world from a slightly different angle.**    
**Your brain (or an algorithm) then compares these two views to figure out how far away objects are.**

## How It Works 
### 1. Two Images
- You start with two images taken at the same time from two slightly separated points—like your left eye and right eye.

### 2. Find Matching Points
- You identify the same object or feature in both images (e.g., the corner of a box).

### 3. Measure Disparity
- Because of perspective, the object will appear shifted in the two images.
This shift is called disparity.

### 4. Compute Depth
- Objects that are closer have a larger disparity, and objects that are farther have a smaller disparity.

## Where Stereo Vision Is Used

- **Self-driving cars** : Detecting distance to pedestrians and obstacles.

- **Robotics** : Allowing robots to perceive their environment in 3D.

- **AR/VR** : Tracking depth for immersive scenes.

- **Drones** : Navigating safely without GPS.

- **3D movies & photography** : Generating depth effects.

## Why It’s Powerful

- No need for expensive sensors like LiDAR  
- Works in real time    
- Gives dense 3D information (depth for every pixel)
